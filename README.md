# Samantha's Touchscreen Mirror 
I put the health information at the very top of my design because I believe out of all the information loaded onto this mirror that health should be the most noticeable and is the most important. If the user clicks on any of the health buttons, the interface will take them to all of the information and data that they have logged in the past. The most recent input will always be the first displayed when the user clicks on the button. The main screen also consists of a calendar button which displays what day it is currently along with a dot indicating if the user has any special events logged for that day. Then there is a news feed button which displays any news the user may be interested in. There is the text message button which is where the user can locate any texts. There is tge time button which displays the current time during the day. There is the social button which stores all the users social apps. Then there is the weather button where the user is displayed a basic overview of what the current days weather is and then when they click on the button, the interface displays the users weather from the past, present, and future.
